# File Encryption/Decryption

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates basic file encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher algorithm. It encrypts the contents of a file and then decrypts it back to the original content.

## How to Use

1. Run the `file_encryption_decryption.py` file.

   ```bash
   $ python file_encryption_decryption.py

The program will encrypt the content of input.txt using the Caesar cipher and save it to encrypted.txt.
It will then decrypt the content of encrypted.txt and save it to decrypted.txt.

EXAMPLE:
File 'input.txt' encrypted successfully. Encrypted content saved to 'encrypted.txt.'
File 'encrypted.txt' decrypted successfully. Decrypted content saved to 'decrypted.txt.'

Customization
Feel free to customize the code to use different encryption keys or algorithms. You can contribute to the project by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.
